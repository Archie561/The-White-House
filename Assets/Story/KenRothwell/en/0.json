            "Vice President: Ken, we're fucking backed into a corner here. We don't have a goddamn choice. This is our last shot. Petrov may be a cunning son of a bitch, but he's our best goddamn bet at saving our asses.",
            "President Ken Rothwell: Fine, Paul. Tell me, how the fuck is this oligarch gonna save the day? I hope you're not feeding me some bullshit.",
            "Vice President: Look, Ken, I don't fucking know the specifics. All I know is Petrov claims he's got the answers. And at this point, does it fucking matter how he does it? We need a goddamn result, and we need it now.",
            "President Ken Rothwell: You better be right about this, Paul. I don't want us selling our souls to the devil just to keep this goddamn factory alive.",
            "Vice President: I'm really fuckin' sick of this, Ken. My head is pounding. He'll call you later today. And I recommend you take him up on his offer. Because if you don't, you're going to have to find another way out of this. And there is no other way."
