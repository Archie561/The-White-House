As you know, the United Kingdom and the United States have long shared a special relationship, built on trust, mutual respect, and shared values.\nTo further deepen this bond, I propose a significant trade agreement that would prioritize UK exports to the US, particularly in key sectors like technology, pharmaceuticals, and renewable energy. This agreement could bring substantial economic benefits to both our nations and send a clear message to the world about our unwavering partnership.\nHowever, this deal would require your administration to relax certain tariffs on British goods, which may face opposition from some of your domestic industries. I understand it’s a challenging decision, but I believe the benefits of reinforcing our alliance far outweigh the drawbacks. Together, we can showcase what true global leadership looks like.
